                    in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. Bali is the only

                <p>The present day Himachal Pradesh has been inhabited since pre-historic times having witnessed multiple waves
                    of human migration from other areas.[11] Through its history, the region was mostly ruled by local kingdoms
                    some of which accepted suzerainty of larger empires. Prior to India's independence from the British,
                    Himachal comprised the hilly regions of Punjab Province of British India. After independence, many of the
                    hilly territories were organized as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh which later became
                    a union territory. In 1966, hilly areas of neighboring Punjab state were merged into Himachal and it was
                    ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.
                </p>
        
                <p>Himachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Almost 90% of the
                    state's population lives in rural areas. Agriculture, horticulture, hydropower and tourism are important
                    constituents of the state's economy. The hilly state is almost universally electrified with 99.5% of the
                    households having electricity as of 2016. The state was declared India's second open-defecation-free state
                    in 2016.[12] According to a survey of CMS – India Corruption Study 2017, Himachal Pradesh is India's least
                    corrupt state

                <p>South India is charming in its own particular path, from the reviving backwaters to the alleviating hill
                    stations or the heavenly hallowed places; the states here are loaded with novel encounters that are certain
                    to bait the visitors. South India truly has a notable culture that separates it from whatever remains of the
                    country. Not just that, every state in south India has figured out how to hold its own particular different
                    identity. Mind boggling sanctuary construction modeling, recorded remnants, palm bordered canals, beach, and
                    hills will furnish you with a fluctuated and intriguing outing to south India. One of the most beautiful
                    attractions in South India is Ooty. Where is Ooty? It is In the Indian state of Tamil Nadu which guarantees
                    harmony. The hill stations of Ooty will persuade you with its rose garden, blue hills, Ooty Lake and deer
                    park. Ooty is well known for its generosity and the beguiling natural wonders.​
                </p>
                <p> The monarch of mounds or Ooty is the most engaging end of the line in South India. Otherwise called
                    Ootacamund, Ooty is the best mount resorts. Arranged in Tamil Nadu, it lures numerous voyagers as it is an
                    exceptionally quiet and tranquil slope station, arranged right at the foothills of the beautiful Nilgiris.
                    It has huge tea estates and enclosures and is at a height of 7000 feet. Like Ooty, Kodaikanal is one of the
                    wonderful hill stations located in the hill of the Dindigul district in Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
                    Kodaikanal is lying in the south of Ooty, and voyaging on the track between these two spots is past

                <p> Mysore (or Mysuru), a city in India's southwestern Karnataka state, was the capital of the Kingdom of Mysore
                    from 1399 to 1947. In its center is opulent Mysore Palace, seat of the former ruling Wodeyar dynasty. The
                    palace blends Hindu, Islamic, Gothic and Rajput styles. Mysore is also home to the centuries-old Devaraja
                    Market, filled with spices, silk and sandalwood.

                <p>t served as the capital city of the Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries from 1399 until 1956. The
                    Kingdom was ruled by the Wadiyar dynasty, with a brief period of interregnum in the 1760s and 70s when Hyder
                    Ali and Tipu Sultan were in power. The Wadiyars were patrons of art and culture and contributed
                    significantly to the cultural and economic growth of the city and the state. The cultural ambiance and
                    achievements of Mysore earned it the sobriquet Cultural Capital of Karnataka.

                <p> Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic
                    conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer
                    capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla
                    Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of
                    integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre,
                    hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu
                    district was named Shimla.

                <p>Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures
                    dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and
                    churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the
                    Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the
                    city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a
                    major tourist attraction.

                    spice plantations. Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to
                    those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.

                    and conquered it soon thereafter. Goa is a former Portuguese province; the Portuguese overseas territory of
                    Portuguese India existed for about 450 years until it was annexed by .India in 1961

                    circuit of UP state, along Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra falls within the Braj cultural region.

                <p>The history of Agra before the Islamic conquerors is unclear. A 17th century chronicle called it an old
                    settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni, before Sikandar made it
                    his capital.[9] The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'ūd Sa'd Salmān writes of an assault on the fortress of
                    Agra, then held by the King Jaypal, by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the
                    place.[10] It was mentioned for the first time in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. Sultan
                    Sikandar Lodī (1488–1517) was the first to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1506. He governed the
                    country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital.

                    Kochi (also known as Cochin) is a city in southwest India's coastal Kerala state. It has been a port since
                    1341, when a flood carved out its harbor and opened it to Arab, Chinese and European merchants. Sites
                    reflecting those influences include Fort Kochi, a settlement with tiled colonial bungalows and diverse
                    houses of worship. Cantilevered Chinese fishing nets, typical of Kochi, have been in use for centuries..

                <p>He was an ethnic Albanian, born in Korçë in eastern Albania. Within the scope of the devshirme system, he
                    studied in the Enderun (palace school) in Istanbul.
                    He was assigned to various posts and became the consultant of two sultans, Murat IV (1623–1640) and İbrahim
                    (1640–1648). He prepared a series of reports
                    (Turkish: Risale) about reforms in the empire. He presented his first report to Murat IV in 1631, and the
                    second to Ibrahim in 1640.[1] Although the literary
                    style of the first was more elaborate than the second, the main points were the same. In his reports he
                    emphasized that the cause of unrest in the empire was
                    the corruption of the timar (fief) system. He suggested a smaller and more disciplined army and a more
                    authoritarian leadership.
